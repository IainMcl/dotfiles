# Workflow

## Before writing code
- Confirm that you have read and understood the project README and CONTRIBUTING files.
- Confirm you are on a feature branch, not `main`. If on `main`, ask before proceeding.
- Read related files to understand existing patterns and conventions before making changes.
- Check for existing tests to use as examples.

## After writing code
- Run tests scoped to your changes.
- Build/compile if the project requires it.
